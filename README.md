# DaChip8 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/DanTup/DaChip8?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DanTup/dachip8)

[DanTup](https://github.com/DanTup/)'s attempt to make a CHIP-8 interpreter in C#.

## ROMs

For testing, I am using the Chip-8 Pack downloaded from [chip8.com](http://www.chip8.com/?page=109). These ROMs are not committed to the repo, so you will need to download and extract them into ROMs/Chip-8 Pack to run.

## Demo

Here's a short video showing `Breakout (Brix hack) [David Winter, 1997].ch8` from the Chip-8 pack. Sound does work but failed to record for this video. I believe the flickering is part of the game, and not my fault!
