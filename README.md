# DaChip8
[DanTup](https://github.com/DanTup/)'s attempt to make a CHIP-8 interpreter in C#.

This is entirely a learning excercise so it is very unlikely to produce a stable polished emulator anytime soon (if ever). If you're looking for something to play CHIP-8 games, this probably isn't it!

## ROMs

For testing, I am using the CHIP-8 Pack downloaded from [chip8.com](http://www.chip8.com/?page=109). These ROMs are not committed to the repo, so you will need to download and extract them into ROMs/Chip-8 Pack to run.
